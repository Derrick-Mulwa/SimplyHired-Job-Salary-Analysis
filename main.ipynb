    "* Full-time jobs tend to have higher salaries than part-time jobs.\n",
    "* The most common job qualifications for high-paying jobs are related to specific technical skills.\n",
    "* The most common job benefits for high-paying jobs include healthcare and retirement plans.\n",
    "* Salaries in certain states tend to be higher than in others.\n",
    "* Jobs that pay annually tend to pay more than jobs that pay monthly or hourly\n",
    "* Senior analyst's roles tend to have higher salaries than junior analyst roles.\n",
    "* Senior analyst jobs tend to have more job benefits than junior analyst jobs.\n",
    "* Senior analyst roles require more qualifications than junior analyst jobs.\n",
